### 1.Run the program

  Copy this folder to a place you want,then using the software eclipse or myeclipse import this project into workspace.The main function is in the file Main.java.

### 2.Function of the project

  The project uses the Perceptron algorithm and with the training examples establishing a simple linear text classifier classifying the text between hockey and baseball.

### 3.Project architecture

  There are five folders s1-s5, which are the original file that had been classified and placed into different folders; While running the project, there will be three new folders created,predata1,keyword and weight.In the predata1,there are five folders just like the original five folders s1-s5,which are the pre-processed datasets.The tree graphic of the file system as bellow:.

* A1.3 Algorithm.pdf : specification of perceptron
* Data : words dictionary
* Perceptron Report.pdf : project report
* data1 : original datasets
* keyword : the key word selected from the training datasets
* lib : lib library
* predata1 : pre-processed data set from original datasets
* src : source code
* weight : weights records while training
* win32 : dll,used for pre-process the datasets, from Pro. Huaping Zhang of Beijing University
