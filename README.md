### 1.Run the program

  Copy this folder to a place you want,then using the software eclipse or myeclipse import this project into workspace.The main function is in the file Main.java.

### 2.Function of the project

  The project uses the Perceptron algorithm and with the training examples establishing a simple linear text classifier classifying the text between hockey and baseball.

### 3.Project architecture

  There are five folders s1-s5, which are the original file that had been classified and placed into different folders; While running the project, there will be three new folders created,predata1,keyword and weight.In the predata1,there are five folders just like the original five folders s1-s5,which are the pre-processed datasets.The tree graphic of the file system as bellow:.

* __A1.3 Algorithm.pdf__ : specification of perceptron
* __Data__ : words dictionary
* __Perceptron Report.pdf__ : project report
* __data1__ : original datasets
* __keyword__ : the key word selected from the training datasets
* __lib__ : lib library
* __predata1__ : pre-processed data set from original datasets
* __src__ : source code
* __weight__ : weights records while training
* __win32__ : dll,used for pre-process the datasets, from Pro. Huaping Zhang of Beijing University
