I/rzt think/v that/c Grant_Fuhr/nr deserves/v more/cc credit/n than/p that/c !/wt 
While/c it's/v true/a that/c the/rzt entire/a Sabres/n team/n played/v very/cc well/d ,/wd I/rzt 
still/d believe/v that/c if/c it/rzt wasn't/v for/p Grant_Fuhr/nr ,/wd the/rzt series/n would/vyou 
now/d be/vshi tied/vd 2/m -/wp 2/m ./wj He/rzt virtually/d stole/v games/n 1/m and/c 3/m for/p the/rzt Sabres/n ./wj 
In/p both/ry of/p these/r games/n ,/wd Fuhr/n stood/v on/p his/rr head/n to/pba give/v the/rzt Sabres/n 
the/rzt chance/n to/pba win/v ./wj Especially/d in/p game/n 3/m ,/wd Fuhr/n made/vd a/rzv series/n of/p 
huge/a stops/n in/p the/rzt third/m period/n when/ry the/rzt score/n was/vshi tied/vd 2/m -/wp 2/m ./wj 
Even/d in/p game/n 2/m when/ry the/rzt Sabres/n won/v 4/m -/wp 0/m ,/wd the/rzt score/n seemed/v to/pba 
indicate/v that/c the/rzt Sabres/n dominated/vd ./wj However/d ,/wd if/c it/rzt hadn't/n been/vshi 
for/p Fuhr/n ,/wd the/rzt Sabres/n wouldn't/v have/vyou been/vshi up/pbei (/wkz 2/m -/wp 0/m I/rzt think/v it/rzt was/vshi )/wky 
through/p the/rzt 2nd/ns period/n and/c the/rzt Bruins/n wouldn't/v have/vyou had/vyou to/pba open/a 
up/pbei the/rzt game/n (/wkz thereby/d allowing/vd Mogilny/n to/pba score/n the/rzt third/m goal/n on/p 
a/rzv breakaway/a to/pba salt/n away/pbei the/rzt game/n )/wky ./wj There/rzs 
is/vshi no/rzt doubt/n in/p my/rr mind/n that/c Fuhr/n was/vshi the/rzt critical/a factor/n in/p the/rzt 
victory/n ./wj 


In/p my/rr opinion/n ,/wd Neely/nr ,/wd Oates/nr and/c Juneau/n played/v as/p well/d as/p 
LaFontaine/n ,/wd Mogilny/n and/c Hawerchuk/n ./wj The/rzt Sabres/n did/vyou get/v 
extraordinary/a efforts/n from/p Hannan/nr ,/wd Sweeney/a ,/wd Wood/n ,/wd and/c Khmylev/n 
(/wkz compared/vd to/pba that/c of/p the/rzt Bruins/n checkers[checker]/n )/wky ./wj However/d ,/wd the/rzt Bruins/n defense/n 
,/wd IMO/nt ,/wd played/v better/a than/p the/rzt Sabres/n defense/n (/wkz the/rzt Sabres/n have/vyou Ken_Sutton/nr 
playing/vi a/rzv regular/a shift/n afterall/n ;/n -/wp )/wky 
The/rzt difference/n in/p the/rzt series/n was/vshi Fuhr/n ,/wd who/ry outplayed/n Andy_Moog/nr ./wj
