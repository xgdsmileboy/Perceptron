My/rr apologies/n for/p the/rzt typo/n -/wp I/rzt meant/v the/rzt Wings/n had/vyou 5/m power/n plays/n in/p the/rzt 
first/m period/n and/c the/rzt Leafs[leaf]/n none/d ./wj 


As/p well/d ,/wd my/rr point/n isn't/n that/c the/rzt refs/n were/vshi biased[bias]/n ,/wd just/d that/c they/rzt were/vshi 
calling/vi a/rzv lot/n of/p penalties/n ,/wd which/rzs works/n to/pba the/rzt benefit/n of/p the/rzt Wings/n ./wj 


Having/vyou the/rzt ref/v call/v a/rzv whole/a bunch/n of/p penalties/n against/p one/m team/n then/d 
calling/vi a/rzv bunch/n against/p the/rzt other/rzs to/pba "/w make/v up/pbei for/p it/rzt "/w takes/v a/rzv lot/n away/pbei 
from/p what/rzs could/vyou have/vyou been/vshi a/rzv great/a game/n ./wj
