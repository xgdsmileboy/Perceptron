|/w >/wm The/rzt thing/n that/c confuses[confuse]/v me/rzv most/cc about/p ESPN/nt is/vshi that/c they/rzt decided/v to/pba show/v the/rzt 
|/w >/wm Penguins/n and/c Devils[devil]/n again/d on/p Thursday/t night/n ./wj Being/vshi that/c both/ry of/p the/rzt first/m 
|/w >/wm two/m games/n were/vshi dominated/vd by/p Pitt/n ./wj ,/wd you/rzt would/vyou think/v that/c they/rzt would/vyou show/v a/rzv 
|/w >/wm different/a game/n ./wj This/r is/vshi in/p addition/n to/pba the/rzt fact/n that/c they/rzt should/vyou show/v other/rzs

ESPN/nt must/vyou have/vyou some/rzv very/cc poor/a marketing/n people/n ./wj They/rzt are/vshi only/d concerned/vd with/p

|/w >/wm Also/d ,/wd some/rzv of/p you/rzt should/vyou know/v that/c (/wkz as/p far/d as/p I/rzt can/vyou tell/v )/wky ESPN/nt is/vshi not/d going/vi 
|/w >/wm to/pba show/v Campbell/nz conference/n games/n regularly/d in/p the/rzt first/m two/m rounds/n ./wj I/rzt

I've/n heard/v that/c this/r is/vshi because/c most/cc of/p their/rr market/n is/vshi East_Coast/nt and/c hence/d 
would/vyou prefer/v the/rzt Wales/nz stuff/n ./wj Also/d ,/wd don't/v expect/v Canadian/an teams/n on/p ESPN/nt ./wj 


In/p summary/n ,/wd if/c you/rzt want/v to/pba see/v a/rzv network/n that/c provides/v good/a hockey/n coverage/n ,/wd 
watch/v CBC_from_Canada/nt ./wj They/rzt may/vyou be/vshi biased[bias]/n toward/p Canadian/an teams/n ,/wd but/c they/rzt 
don't/v treat/v the/rzt viewers/vd like/p idiots[idiot]/n ,/wd they/rzt provide/v nice/a updates/n ,/wd and/c Don_Cherry/nr 
will/vyou always/d provide/v a/rzv few/rzs laughs/n ./wj
