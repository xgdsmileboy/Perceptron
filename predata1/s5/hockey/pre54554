The/rzt first/m time/n I/rzt heard/v this/r piece/n of/p news/n was/vshi on/p the/rzt post/n game/n radio/n 
interview/n here/d in/p Jyvaskyla/n ./wj That/c was/vshi the/rzt bronze/a medal/n game/n in/p the/rzt 
SM/d -/wp liiga/n which/rzs Tichonov/n 's/c team/n Porin/n Assat/n (/wkz the/rzt Aces/n of/p town/n Pori/n :/wm )/wky 
lost/vd ./wj Vasili/n ,/wd the/rzt son/n of/p Victor_Tichonov/nr (/wkz the/rzt famous/a Soviet/nz coach/n )/wky ,/wd 
said/v that/c for/p a/rzv long/a time/n the/rzt Sharks/vi have/vyou been/vshi persuading/vd him/rzt to/pba 
take/v the/rzt assistant/n coach/n post/n ./wj But/c he/rzt wants/v to/pba be/vshi the/rzt head/n coach/n where/ry 
ever/d he/rzt goes/v ./wj He/rzt definitely/d won't/v be/vshi coaching/n Assat/n anymore/r (/wkz after/p 
three/m ?/ww seasons/n )/wky ./wj I/rzt don't/v know/v why/ry ./wj 


Vasili/n is/vshi a/rzv good/a coach/n I/rzt believe/v ./wj Assat/n was/vshi a/rzv good/a team/n ,/wd produced/vd many/rzs 
players/n to/pba our/rr national/a team/n ./wj Assat/n wasn't/v a/rzv skilled/a team/n (/wkz IMHO/nt )/wky but/c 
they/rzt had/vyou the/rzt fighting/n spirit/n ./wj After/p all/a ,/wd they/rzt butcher[butcher]/nr1 Jokerit/n in/p the/rzt 
playoffs[playoff]/a and/c gave/v hard/a time/n to/pba TPS/nt ,/wd the/rzt champs/n ./wj But/c Assat/n wasn't/v 
consistent/a ,/wd only/d when/ry they/rzt were/vshi in/p the/rzt right/a mood/n they/rzt could/vyou beat/n any/rzv 
team/n in/p the/rzt SM/d -/wp liiga/n ./wj 


I/rzt am/vshi not/d 100%/m sure/a about/p the/rzt deal/n with/p the/rzt Sharks/vi ./wj As/p I/rzt said/v ,/wd he/rzt wants/v 
to/pba be/vshi the/rzt head/n coach/n ./wj But/c he/rzt and/c the/rzt Sharks/vi are/vshi going/vi to/pba negotiate/v and/c 
decide/v during/p the/rzt WC/n ./wj I/rzt doubt/n that/c he/rzt will/vyou be/vshi the/rzt head/n coach/n but/c 
maybe/d they'll/rzt do/vyou some/rzv compromise/n ./wj 


Could/vyou somebody/r post/n more/cc information/n about/p Vasili/n ?/ww I/rzt know/v he/rzt was/vshi coaching/n
