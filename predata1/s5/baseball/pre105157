>/wm :/wm I'm/n german/an and/c I/rzt have/vyou been/vshi into/p this/r MLB/nt stuff/n since/p almost/d one/m year/n now/d ./wj 
>/wm :/wm There/rzs are/vshi many/rzs problems/n occuring/n for/p me/rzv ./wj One/m of/p them/rzt is/vshi the/rzt ERA/n statistic/n for/p 
>/wm :/wm pitchers/n ./wj What/rzs does/vyou it/rzt say/v ?/ww ?/ww 


>/wm ERA/n indicates/v the/rzt average/a number/n of/p earned/v runs/n attributed/vd to/pba a/rzv pitcher/n per/p 
>/wm nine/m inning/n game/n ./wj Thus/d ,/wd if/c a/rzv pitcher/n pitched/v 3/m innings[inning]/n and/c gave/v up/pbei 1/m earned/v 
>/wm run/v ,/wd his/rr 9/m inning/n equivelent/n perfomance/n would/vyou be/vshi 3/m earned/v runs/n ,/wd thus/d his/rr ERA/n 
>/wm is/vshi 3.00/m ./wj To/pba compute/v the/rzt ERA/n you/rzt simply/d take/v the/rzt number/n of/p earned/v runs/n divided/vd 
>/wm by/p the/rzt innings[inning]/n pitched/v and/c then/d multiple/a the/rzt result/n by/p 9/m ./wj 


>/wm ERA/n =/n (/wkz ER/u //wp IP/v )/wky */n 9/m 


I/rzt think/v there/rzs is/vshi another/r formula/n for/p ERA/n ./wj I/rzt heard/v something/r about/p it/rzt last/rzs 
year./n Im/u not/d sure/a what/rzs it/rzt is/vshi ,/wd but/c im/u gonna/vi give/v it/rzt a/rzv stab/n ./wj It/rzt allows/v for/p 
a/rzv pitcher/n to/pba pitch/n more/cc than/p 9/m innings[inning]/n at/p a/rzv time/n and/c not/d benefit/n ,/wd cuz/n it/rzt 
uses/v out[out]/pbei recorded/vd instead/d of/p innings[inning]/n pitched../n ./wj 


ERA/n =/n (/wkz ER/u */n 27/m )/wky //wp out[out]/pbei recorded/vd 


Like/p i/rzt said/v ,/wd im/u not/d sure/a this/r is/vshi exactly/d it/rzt ,/wd but/c im/u pretty/d sure/a they/rzt changed/vd 
it/rzt to/pba something/r of/p the/rzt sort/n ./wj
