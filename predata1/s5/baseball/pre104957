>/wm Ideally/d ,/wd DHs/n "/w should/vyou "/w be/vshi the/rzt strongest/a offensive/a players/n ,/wd because/c

>/wm not/d ?/ww Is/vshi it/rzt always/d this/r way/n ?/ww )/wky then/d we/rzt are/vshi going/vi to/pba have/vyou trouble/n finding/vi the/rzt 
>/wm true/a value/n of/p DHs/n using/vi the/rzt same/rzs models/n as/p that/c for/p position/n players/n ./wj 


There/rzs are/vshi several/rzs reasons/n for/p this/r difference/n ./wj The/rzt main/a reason/n is/vshi that/c 
good/a hitters/n in/p their/rr prime/n (/wkz such/p as/p Frank_Thomas/nr and/c Danny_Tartabull/nr )/wky 
are/vshi rarely/d regular/a DH/nt 's/c ,/wd even/d if/c they/rzt can't/v field/n ;/n it's/v more/cc commonly/d a/rzv 
place/v to/pba put/v aging/n veterans/n ./wj 


Another/r use/n of/p the/rzt DH/nt slot/n is/vshi to/pba help/v a/rzv player/nr1 come/v back/pbei from/p injury/n 
slowly/d ,/wd getting/vi his/rr bat/n in/p the/rzt lineup/n without/p forcing/vi him/rzt to/pba play/n in/p the/rzt 
field/n ./wj I/rzt would/vyou expect/v such/p players/n to/pba hit/v worse/a as/p DH/nt 's/c than/p they/rzt did/vyou 
during/p the/rzt rest/n of/p the/rzt season/n ./wj 


A/rzv third/m factor/n is/vshi that/c most/cc player/nr1 who/ry split/n time/n between/p DH/nt and/c first/m 
or/c the/rzt outfield/n don't/v hit/v as/p well/d as/p DH/nt 's/c for/p some/rzv reason/n ./wj Reggie/nr 
Jackson/nz was/vshi a/rzv good/a example/n ;/n in/p five/m years/n as/p a/rzv RF/nt //wp DH/nt for/p the/rzt Angels/n ,/wd he/rzt 
hit/v like/p the/rzt old/a Reggie/nr when/ry he/rzt was/vshi in/p right/a ./wj 


The/rzt second/m and/c third/m factors/n will/vyou be/vshi lost/vd if/c players/n are/vshi considered/vd by/p 
their/rr primary/a position/n only/d ;/n a/rzv player/nr1 who/ry plays/n 90/m games/n in/p right/a and/c 60/m 
at/p DH/nt will/vyou count/n only/d in/p the/rzt right/a fielders'/n averages/n ./wj 


>/wm A/rzv logical/a starting/v place/v would/vyou be/vshi to/pba look/v at/p defensive/a replacement/n 
>/wm value/n (/wkz if/c you/rzt can/vyou find/v it/rzt )/wky for/p 1B/ns or/c LF/nt or/c something/r ./wj We/rzt can/vyou assume/v that/c 
>/wm if/c forced/vd to/pba play/n defense/n they/rzt would/vyou play/n at/p true/a zero/m value/n ,/wd even/d though/c I/rzt 
>/wm doubt/n this/r is/vshi actually/d true/a for/p players/n like/p Winfield/nr and/c Molitor/n ./wj This/r 
>/wm would/vyou let/v us/rzv "/w discount/n "/w the/rzt time/n they/rzt spend/v playing/vi DH/nt ,/wd because/c that/c 
>/wm forces/n the/rzt team/n to/pba find/v another/r real/a fielder/n to/pba play/n ./wj 


This/r makes/v sense/n ;/n you/rzt might/vyou also/d look/v at/p it/rzt another/r way/n ./wj Although/c the/rzt 
*/n average/a */n offensive/a performance/n of/p a/rzv DH/nt may/vyou be/vshi lower/a than/p for/p a/rzv left/vd
