Mark_Singer/nr brings/v up/pbei the/rzt Strawberry/n Incident/n ,/wd where/ry he/rzt lost/vd a/rzv homerun/n 
and/c the/rzt fan/n caught/v it./rzt 


|/w >/wm Before/p each/r Dodger/n game/n the/rzt public/a address/n announcer/nr1 makes/v a/rzv speech/n 
|/w >/wm wherein/ry he/rzt says/v that/c fans/n are/vshi welcome/a to/pba the/rzt souvenirs/n of/p balls/n that/c 
|/w >/wm are/vshi hit/v into/p the/rzt stands/v as/p long/a as/p they/rzt do/vyou not/d interfere/v with/p any/rzv 
|/w >/wm that/c are/vshi in/p the/rzt field/n of/p play/n ./wj Was/vshi the/rzt fan/n wrong/a ?/ww Should/vyou he/rzt have/vyou 
|/w >/wm been/vshi more/cc aware/a of/p the/rzt situation/n and/c acted/v to/pba avoid/v any/rzv possibility/n

Yes/o ,/wd I/rzt think/v he/rzt should/vyou have/vyou done/vd more/cc to/pba get/v out/pbei of/p the/rzt way/n ./wj As/p much/d 
as/p fans/n want/v to/pba catch/v a/rzv ball/n ,/wd they/rzt really/d should/vyou be/vshi aware/a that/c winning/a 
the/rzt game/n is/vshi more/cc important/a ./wj As/p a/rzv Dodger/n fan/n ,/wd he/rzt has/vyou to/pba be/vshi aware/a that/c 
this/r is/vshi the/rzt home/n stadium/ns ,/wd and/c that/c entails/v helping/vi the/rzt home/n team/n win/v 
in/p any/rzv way/n possible/a ./wj As/p soon/d as/p the/rzt ball/n was/vshi hit/v that/c far/d ,/wd his/rr first/m 
instinct/n should/vyou be/vshi to/pba root/n for/p Darryl/nr to/pba catch/v it/rzt ,/wd not/d to/pba try/v to/pba catch/v 
it/rzt himself/rzv ,/wd particularly/d when/ry he/rzt is/vshi sitting/vi that/c close/d ./wj 


I/rzt enjoy/v the/rzt attitude/n of/p the/rzt Wrigley/n fans/n ,/wd where/ry they/rzt are/vshi against/p 
visiting/a team/n home/n runs/n so/cc much/d ,/wd they/rzt actually/d throw/v them/rzt back/pbei on/p the/rzt 
field/n ./wj 


Now/d ,/wd this/r has/vyou nothing/r to/pba do/vyou with/p whether/c Darryl/nr could/vyou have/vyou caught/v it/rzt or/c 
not/d ./wj Sure/a ,/wd he/rzt probably/d screwed/vd up/pbei ,/wd but/c the/rzt fan/n should/vyou realize/v his/rr 
first/m responsibility/n is/vshi to/pba get/v out/pbei of/p the/rzt way/n and/c help/v the/rzt team/n win/v ./wj
