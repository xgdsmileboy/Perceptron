If/c a/rzv team/n uses/v 40/m players/n in/p a/rzv season/n do/vyou you/rzt merely/d divide/v the/rzt total/a +/wp //wp -/wp 
by/p 40/m ?/ww If/c so/cc ,/wd a/rzv player/nr1 who/ry plays/n in/p only/d 1/m game/n is/vshi considered/vd equally/d

Since/p the/rzt standard/n deviation/n for/p each/r team/n is/vshi different/a ,/wd I/rzt am/vshi unsure/a how/ry 
"/w transferable/n "/w between/p teams/n that/c these/r stats/n are/vshi ./wj Shouldn't/n the/rzt average/a
