Did/vyou anyone/r notice/n the/rzt words/n "/w NOT/d FOR/p BASEBALL/n "/w printed/vd on/p the/rzt picture/n 
of/p Joe_Robbie_Stadium/nr in/p the/rzt Opening_Day/ns season/n preview/n section/n in/p USA/nt 
Today/t ?/ww Any/rzv reason/n given/vd for/p this/r ?/ww 


Also/d ,/wd I/rzt just/d noticed/v something/r looking/vi at/p the/rzt Nolan_Ryan/nr timeline/n in/p 
the/rzt preview/n ./wj On/p 8/m //wp 22/m //wp 89/m ,/wd Rickey_Henderson/nr became/v Nolan/nr 's/c 5000th/n strikeout/n ./wj 
On/p 6/m //wp 11/m //wp 90/m he/rzt pitched/v his/rr 6th/ns no/rzt -/wp hitter/n against/p Oakland/n ./wj I/rzt believe/v the/rzt 
last/rzs out/pbei in/p the/rzt game/n was/vshi made/vd by/p Rickey_Henderson/nr ./wj And/c on/p 5/m //wp 1/m //wp 91/m ,/wd Nolan/nr 
pitched/v his/rr 7th/ns no/rzt -/wp hitter/n on/p the/rzt same/rzs day/n a/rzv certain/a someone/r stole/v his/rr 
939th/n base/n ,/wd which/rzs overshadowed/vd it./rzt It/rzt seems/v that/c Nolan/nr is/vshi having/vyou a/rzv lot/n of/p 
publicity/n at/p Rickey/nr 's/c expense/n ./wj IMO/nt ,/wd Rickey/nr deserves/v it/rzt ,/wd and/c it/rzt seems/v as/p 
most/cc of/p the/rzt net/n agrees/n with/p me/rzv from/p what/rzs I've/n seen/vd on/p it/rzt lately/d ./wj They/rzt are/vshi 
both/ry great/a players/n ,/wd but/c IMO/nt ,/wd Nolan/nr has/vyou outclassed/n Rickey/nr ,/wd both/ry in/p playing/vi 
and/c more/cc importantly/n ,/wd in/p attitude/n ./wj Just/d my/rr thoughts/n ./wj
