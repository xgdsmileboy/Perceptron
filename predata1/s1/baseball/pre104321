Of/p course/n a/rzv run/v scored/v is/vshi just/d as/p important/a as/p a/rzv run/v prevented/vd ./wj 
Just/d as/p a/rzv penny/n saved/vd is/vshi a/rzv penny/n earned/v ./wj Enough/a with/p the/rzt cliches/n ./wj 
My/rr point/n is/vshi that/c IF/c the/rzt Braves/nz starters[starter]/n are/vshi able/a to/pba live/v up/pbei to/pba 
their/rr potential/n ,/wd they/rzt won't/v need/n much/d offensive/a support/n ./wj 
I/rzt realize/v this/r is/vshi a/rzv BIG/a IF/c ./wj This/r staff/n leaves/n the/rzt '92/m BoSox/n in/p the/rzt dust/n ./wj 
There/rzs is/vshi no/rzt legitimate/a comparison/n ./wj Two/m Cy/n Young/a winners/n ,/wd and/c three/m other/rzs 
pitchers/n that/c most/cc any/rzv team/n in/p the/rzt league/n would/vyou kill/v to/pba have/vyou as/p their/rr first/m 
or/c second/m starter/n ./wj It/rzt seems/v to/pba me/rzv that/c when/ry quality/n pitchers/n take/v the/rzt 
mound/n ,/wd the/rzt other/rzs teams/n score/n less/rzs runs/n ./wj The/rzt team/n that/c scores/n the/rzt most/cc 
runs/n wins/v ./wj This/r puts/v the/rzt team/n with/p the/rzt better/a pitching/n at/p the/rzt advantage/n 
(/wkz providing/vi they/rzt can/vyou stop/v the/rzt opposing/a team/n from/p scoring/n runs/n )/wky ./wj A/rzv low/a 
scoring/n game/n would/vyou clearly/d benefit/n the/rzt Braves/nz ./wj They/rzt should/vyou have/vyou many/rzs 
low/a scoring/n games/n due/a to/pba their/rr excellent/a pitching/n and/c below/p average/a hitting/vi ./wj 
On/p the/rzt flip/nz side/n ,/wd if/c you/rzt had/vyou a/rzv starting/v lineup/n of/p great/a offensive/a players/n ,/wd 
I/rzt would/vyou be/vshi arguing/v that/c this/r team/n would/vyou not/d need/n great/a pitchers/n ./wj 
They/rzt would/vyou have/vyou an/rzv advantage/n because/c they/rzt could/vyou simply/d outscore/n their/rr 
opponent/n ./wj The/rzt name/n of/p the/rzt games/n is/vshi to/pba win/v ./wj Even/d Ray_Knight/nr knows/vd that/c 
you/rzt do/vyou this/r by/p putting/vi more/cc runs/n up/pbei on/p the/rzt scoreboard/n ./wj 
All/a I'm/n trying/vi to/pba say/v is/vshi that/c if/c you/rzt assemble/v the/rzt quality/n pitchers/n 
like/p the/rzt Braves/nz have/vyou ,/wd the/rzt offense/n doesn't/n need/n to/pba be/vshi as/p strong/a ./wj
