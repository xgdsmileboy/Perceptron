Well/d ,/wd I/rzt think/v is/vshi complete/a bs/n ./wj What/rzs happened/v most/cc of/p the/rzt time/n is/vshi that/c 
Morris/nz fell/v behind/p ,/wd and/c the/rzt team/n came/v back/pbei and/c rescued/vd him/rzt ./wj Mostly/d ,/wd 
this/r is/vshi because/c he/rzt 's/c a/rzv lousy/a 1st/ns inning/n pitcher/n ,/wd and/c much/d better/a 
the/rzt rest/n of/p the/rzt way/n ./wj That/c the/rzt team/n can/vyou climb/n out/pbei of/p 4/m -/wp 0/m ,/wd 5/m -/wp 0/m holes/n

team/n 's/c credit/n ./wj 


Furthermore/d ,/wd while/c Morris/nz did/vyou exceed/v the/rzt W/n -/wp L/o percentage/n that/c would/vyou 
be/vshi projected/a from/p his/rr runs/n allowed/vd and/c run/v support/n ,/wd he/rzt hasn't/n done/vd 
this/r in/p previous/a years/n ./wj In/p fact/n ,/wd his/rr W/n -/wp L/o record/n in/p 1991/m is/vshi a/rzv lot/n 
worse/a than/p what/rzs it/rzt projects/n to/pba be/vshi with/p run/v support/n and/c runs/n allowed/vd ./wj 
Do/vyou you/rzt think/v he/rzt just/d came/v up/pbei with/p this/r ability/n in/p 1992/m ./wj 


Look/v at/p the/rzt 2/m postseason/n games/n he/rzt pitched/v decently[decent]/a in./n Typical/a 
Morris/nz games/n ./wj Morris/nz gets/v behind/p ;/n team/n rescues[rescue]/n him/rzt ./wj He/rzt 's/c not/d
