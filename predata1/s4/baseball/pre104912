I've/n been/vshi a/rzv Giants/n season/n ticket/n holder/n for/p years/n and/c never/d really/d complained/v 
about/p the/rzt old/a ballyard/n place/v ./wj Sure/a ,/wd it's/v been/vshi cold/a ,/wd the/rzt food/n lines/n were/vshi long/a ,/wd 
and/c the/rzt hired/a hands/n were/vshi surly/a ,/wd but/c this/r was/vshi all/a part/n of/p the/rzt Giants/n mystique/n ./wj 
Or/c so/cc I/rzt thought/v ./wj 


I/rzt went/v to/pba Tuesday/t 's/c game/n (/wkz 3/m -/wp 1/m Giants/n over/p the/rzt marlin[marlin]/nz )/wky and/c the/rzt 'Stick/n was/vshi 
a/rzv much/d different/a place/v ./wj Nothing/r short/a of/p a/rzv dome/n will/vyou eliminate/v the/rzt wind/n ,/wd but/c 
everything/r is/vshi a/rzv lot/n better/a ./wj The/rzt lines/n are/vshi a/rzv lot/n shorter/a ,/wd the/rzt bathrooms[bathroom]/n are/vshi 
CLEAN/a and/c have/vyou running/vi water/ns ,/wd and/c the/rzt hired/a hands/n were/vshi very/cc polite/a ./wj 


The/rzt new/a foghorn/n (/wkz lights/n up/pbei and/c blows/n after/p each/r homerun/n )/wky and/c the/rzt wooden/a fence/n 
are/vshi very/cc nice/a ,/wd as/p are/vshi the/rzt new/a bleachers/n ./wj The/rzt bleachers/n start/n right/a at/p the/rzt top/n 
of/p the/rzt fence/n and/c give/v a/rzv great/a view/n ,/wd and/c they've/n got/v beer/n stands/v at/p the/rzt 
bottome/n of/p the/rzt bleachers/n ./wj The/rzt only/d complaint/n is/vshi that/c the/rzt electronic/a 
old/a -/wp fashioned/a scoreboard/n looks/v electronic/a -/wp could/vyou be/vshi better/a ./wj 


These/r things/n should/vyou have/vyou been/vshi done/vd a/rzv long/a time/n ago/d ,/wd but/c it/rzt took/v a/rzv real/a 
businessman/n (/wkz ex/u -/wp Safeway_President_Peter_Magowan/nt )/wky to/pba figure/n it/rzt out/pbei ./wj Just/d 
like/p he/rzt used/vd to/pba tell/v his/rr checkers[checker]/n ,/wd "/w If/c the/rzt customers/n don't/v come/v back/pbei ,/wd I/rzt don't/v 
need/n as/p many/rzs checkers[checker]/n "/w ./wj This/r isn't/n a/rzv knock/v on/p Bob_Lurie/nr -/wp he/rzt was/vshi a/rzv competent/a 
businessman/n but/c he/rzt didn't/v deal/n much/d with/p the/rzt general/nl public/a ./wj 


I'll/n give/v an/rzv example/n of/p how/ry the/rzt level/n of/p service/n has/vyou changed/vd ./wj The/rzt onion/n 
dispenser/v jammed/vd as/p I/rzt was/vshi using/vi it./rzt An/rzv attendant/nr1 came/v over/p ,/wd apoligized/n for/p 
the/rzt problem/n and/c proceeded/n to/pba fix/v the/rzt machine/n ./wj After/p he/rzt was/vshi done/vd ,/wd he/rzt cleaned/vd 
the/rzt machine/n and/c said/v he/rzt was/vshi glad/a to/pba be/vshi able/a to/pba help/v ./wj In/p the/rzt old/a days/n ,/wd there/rzs 
was/vshi no/rzt attendant/nr1 and/c the/rzt folks/n at/p the/rzt concession/n stands/v would/vyou say/v "/w Go/v to/pba 
the/rzt stand/v 100/m feet/n away/pbei -/wp they/rzt might/vyou be/vshi able/a to/pba help/v "/w ./wj
