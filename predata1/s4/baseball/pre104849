Is/vshi there/rzs any/rzv judgement[judgment]/n call/v on/p the/rzt part/n of/p the/rzt scorer/n for/p sac/n fly/n RBI/nt 's/c ?/ww 
This/r is/vshi the/rzt situation/n that/c brought/vd the/rzt question/n up/pbei :/wm 


The/rzt Red_Sox/nt were/vshi up/pbei in/p the/rzt bottom/n of/p the/rzt 9th/ns by/p a/rzv score/n of/p 5/m -/wp 1/m ./wj The/rzt Mariners/n 
had/vyou the/rzt bases/n loaded/vd with/p 1/m out/pbei ./wj The/rzt batter/n hits/a a/rzv fly/n to/pba center/n ,/wd which/rzs the/rzt 
fielder/n catch[catch]/v ./wj The/rzt runner/a at/p third/m tags[tag]/n and/c scores/n without/p a/rzv throw/v ./wj 


Now/d ,/wd without/p a/rzv judgement[judgment]/n call/v (/wkz and/c I/rzt don't/v think/v there/rzs is/vshi one/m )/wky ,/wd this/r is/vshi an/rzv RBI/nt 
for/p the/rzt batter/n ./wj It/rzt seems/v to/pba me/rzv that/c a/rzv better/a name/n for/p this/r would/vyou be/vshi "/w defensive/a 
indifference/n "/w ,/wd since/p it/rzt doesn't/n really/d matter/n whether/c the/rzt guy/n at/p third/m scores/n 
at/p that/c point/n ./wj (/wkz I/rzt know/v ,/wd I/rzt can/vyou think/v of/p several/rzs "/w If/c the/rzt Mariners/n stole/v third/m 
and/c second/m ,/wd which/rzs opening/n the/rzt base/n would/vyou allow/v ,/wd and/c then/d the/rzt batter/n hit/v a/rzv 
grounder/vd which/rzs the/rzt third/m baseman/a gets/v deep/a in/p the/rzt hole/n between/p himself/rzv and/c 
third/m ,/wd he/rzt wouldn't/v have/vyou a/rzv play/n at/p home/n ,/wd third/m ,/wd or/c second/m for/p the/rzt out/pbei ,/wd and/c 
maybe/d he/rzt therefore/d can't/v make/v the/rzt throw/v to/pba first/m to/pba get/v the/rzt last/rzs out/pbei ,/wd etc../n ./wj 
scenarios/n ,/wd too/cc ./wj But/c does/vyou it/rzt _really_/n matter/n if/c this/r guy/n scores/n this/r way/n when/ry 
you're/n down/pbei by/p 4/m ?/ww If/c the/rzt tying/vi run/v is/vshi going/vi to/pba score/n ,/wd so/cc is/vshi the/rzt guy/n on/p third/m ./wj )/wky 


The/rzt point/n is/vshi that/c the/rzt batter/n (/wkz IMO/nt )/wky shouldn't/n get/v "/w credit/n "/w (/wkz an/rzv RBI/nt )/wky for/p utterly/d 
failing/vi to/pba do/vyou his/rr job/n -/wp which/rzs at/p this/r point/n is/vshi to/pba get/v a/rzv hit/v or/c a/rzv walk/n ,/wd not/d 
trade/n an/rzv out/pbei for/p one/m run/v ./wj What/rzs do/vyou you/rzt guys/n think/v ?/ww
