Lots/n of/p debate/n about/p the/rzt virtues/n of/p Bryan_Murray/nr vs/n Pat_Quinn/nr as/p a/rzv GM/nt 
deleted[delete]/n ./wj Randy/d Graca/n seems/v to/pba think/v Murray/nz is/vshi the/rzt best/a GM/nt in/p the/rzt league/n ./wj 
I/rzt think/v Quinn/nr is/vshi one/m of/p several/rzs who/ry are/vshi better/a ./wj 


>/wm >/wm Plus/p his/rr team/n (/wkz Quinn/nr 's/c )/wky has/vyou improved/a a/rzv much/d greater/a amount/n than/p Detroit/nz since/p

>/wm They/rzt both/ry won/v their/rr division/n ,/wd they/rzt had/vyou close/d to/pba the/rzt same/rzs number/n of/p points/n ,/wd

When/ry Quinn/nr took/v over/p Vancouver/n -/wp several/rzs years/n ago/d ,/wd NOT/d LAST/rzs YEAR/n ,/wd they/rzt 
regularily/n missed/v the/rzt playoffs[playoff]/a ./wj I/rzt can't/v recall/v if/c they/rzt missed/v the/rzt playoffs[playoff]/a 
the/rzt year/n before/p his/rr hiring/d but/c they/rzt probably/d did/vyou ./wj Quinn/nr has/vyou improved/a the/rzt 
team/n from/p non/u -/wp playoff/a calibre/n to/pba a/rzv serious/a contender/v ./wj 


When/ry Murray/nz took/v over/p in/p Detroit/nz ,/wd the/rzt were/vshi about/p a/rzv .500/m team/n that/c was/vshi a/rzv 
contender/v to/pba win/v the/rzt Norris/nr division/n and/c possibly/n even/d a/rzv Stanley_Cup/nr 
contender/v ./wj 


So/cc Quinn/nr has/vyou improved/a his/rr team/n more/cc than/p Murray/nz has/vyou since/p taking/vi over/p as/p a/rzv GM./n 
Quinn/nr is/vshi one/m example/n of/p a/rzv better/a GM_than_Murray/nt ./wj
