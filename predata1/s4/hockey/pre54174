Is/vshi it/rzt just/d me/rzv or/c is/vshi the/rzt camera/n work/n on/p some/rzv of/p these/r games/n really/d sad/a ?/ww ?/ww I/rzt 
can't/v remember/v how/ry many/rzs times/n during/p the/rzt Penguins/n -/wp Devils[devil]/n game/n they/rzt showed/v some/rzv 
guy/n (/wkz without/p the/rzt puck/n )/wky being/vshi checked/vd in/p the/rzt corner/n while/c the/rzt puck/n was/vshi being/vshi 
fired/vd on/p goal/n ./wj In/p fact/n ,/wd I/rzt think/v they/rzt even/d missed/v one/m goal/n completely/d because/c 
they/rzt were/vshi showing/vi two/m guys/n holding/vi each/r other/rzs in/p the/rzt corner/n ./wj 


Now/d the/rzt last/rzs time/n I/rzt watched/v a/rzv football/n game/n ,/wd they/rzt didn't/v show/v the/rzt lineman/vd going/vi 
at/p it/rzt while/c the/rzt running/vi back/pbei turned/v the/rzt corner/n for/p a/rzv touchdown/n ./wj ./wj ./wj ./wj 


Is/vshi it/rzt just/d me/rzv ?/ww ?/ww
