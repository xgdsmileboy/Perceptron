Gretzky/n ,/wd Lemieux/nr ,/wd Gilmour/n etc/n do/vyou not/d play/n the/rzt role/n of/p checking/n centreman/n ./wj 
They/rzt play/n an/rzv offensive/a role/n as/p opposed/vd to/pba a/rzv defensive/a one/m ./wj If/c they/rzt 
were/vshi used/vd as/p defensive/a center[center]/n it/rzt would/vyou be/vshi a/rzv waste/n of/p their/rr offensive/a

When/ry you/rzt compare/v Gretzky/n et/u al/nz to/pba Jarvis/nr ,/wd Gainey/nr etc/n you/rzt are/vshi comparing/vd 
apples/n and/c oranges/n ./wj It/rzt is/vshi like/p me/rzv telling/vi you/rzt that/c Felix_Potvin/nr isn't/n 
very/cc good/a because/c a/rzv team/n would/vyou be/vshi better/a if/c the/rzt had/vyou Lemieux/nr instead/d of/p 
him/rzt ./wj Sure_Lemieux/nr is/vshi a/rzv better/a player/nr1 ,/wd but/c he/rzt is/vshi a/rzv different/a type/a of/p 
player/nr1 ./wj For/p a/rzv team/n to/pba be/vshi successful/a ,/wd they/rzt need/n to/pba have/vyou all/a types/n of/p 
players/n -/wp this/r includes/v defensive/a forward[forward]/d ./wj 


When/ry compared/vd with/p other/rzs defensive/a forward[forward]/d ,/wd Bob_Gainey/nr is/vshi the/rzt greatest/a 
defensive/a forward/d ever/d ./wj He/rzt is/vshi the/rzt player/nr1 who's/v talents/n best/a suited/n being/vshi 
a/rzv defensive/a forward/d -/wp who/ry completely/d dominated/vd the/rzt game/n when/ry he/rzt played/v ./wj 


Maybe/d if/c a/rzv more/cc talented/n player/nr1 such/p as/p Gretzky/n had/vyou decided/v to/pba waste/n his/rr
