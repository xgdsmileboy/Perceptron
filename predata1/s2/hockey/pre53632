I/rzt think/v that/c you/rzt are/vshi incorrect/a ,/wd Roger/nz ./wj Patrick/n ,/wd 
Smythe/nz and/c Adams/nz all/a played/v or/c coached[coach]/n in/p the/rzt league/n before/p becoming/v

they/rzt were/vshi not/d great/a players/n themselves/rzv ./wj 


I/rzt agree/v that/c a/rzv name/n is/vshi a/rzv name/n is/vshi a/rzv name/n ,/wd and/c if/c some/rzv people/n 
have/vyou trouble/n with/p names/n that/c are/vshi not/d easily/d processed/vd by/p the/rzt fans/n ,/wd 
then/d changing/a them/rzt to/pba names/n that/c are/vshi more/cc easily/d processed/vd seems/v like/p 
a/rzv reasonable/a idea/n ./wj If/c we/rzt can/vyou get/v people/n in/p the/rzt (/wkz arena/n )/wky door/n by/p being/vshi 
uncomplicated/a ,/wd then/d let's/v do/vyou so/cc ./wj Once/d we/rzt have/vyou them/rzt ,/wd they/rzt will/vyou realize/v

No/rzt ,/wd I/rzt would/vyou not/d want/v to/pba see/v a/rzv Ballard/nr division/n ./wj But/c to/pba say/v 
that/c these/r owners/n are/vshi assholes/n ,/wd hence/d all/a NHL/nt management/n people/n are/vshi

you/rzt might/vyou be/vshi saying/vi is/vshi that/c the/rzt players/n have/vyou not/d made/vd as/p much/d money/n as/p

the/rzt game/n great/a not/d the/rzt people/n who/ry put/v them/rzt on/p the/rzt ice/n ,/wd so/cc naming/vi
