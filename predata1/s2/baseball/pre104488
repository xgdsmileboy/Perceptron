Well/d ,/wd I/rzt agree/v that/c Viola/n is/vshi a/rzv better/a signing/vi ./wj However/d ,/wd why/ry does/vyou 
everyone/r say/v that/c you/rzt want/v lefthanded/n starters[starter]/n ?/ww I/rzt understand/v lefthanded/n 
spot/n relievers/n ,/wd even/d though/c they/rzt usually/d face/n more/cc righthanded/n batters[batter]/n 
than/p lefthanded/n batters[batter]/n ./wj I/rzt just/d don't/v understand/v why/ry people/n insist/v 
on/p lefthanded/n starters[starter]/n ,/wd unless/c there/rzs is/vshi a/rzv park/n effect/n (/wkz e.g./n ,/wd Yankee_Stadium/ns )/wky ./wj 
Most/cc batters[batter]/n in/p MLB/nt are/vshi righthanded/n ,/wd so/cc righthanded/n starters[starter]/n will/vyou have/vyou 
the/rzt platoon/n advantage/n more/cc often/d than/p lefthanded/n starters[starter]/n ./wj 
I/rzt guess/v one/m argument/n for/p lefty/d starters[starter]/n is/vshi that/c certain/a teams/n 
may/vyou be/vshi more/cc vulnerable/a to/pba LHP/nt 's/c than/p RHP's/n ./wj However/d ,/wd this/r is/vshi probably/d

for/p this/r reason/n during/p the/rzt regular/a season/n ./wj 


I/rzt think/v you/rzt just/d want/v the/rzt best/a starters[starter]/n you/rzt can/vyou get/v ,/wd regardless/d of/p

higher/a ERA/n 's/c than/p righthanded/n starters[starter]/n ,/wd precisely/d because/c managers/n 
go/v out/pbei of/p their/rr way/n to/pba start/n inferior/a lefties/n (/wkz or/c perhaps/d because/c of/p
