The/rzt Dodgers/n have/vyou been/vshi shopping/n Harris/nz to/pba other/rzs teams/n in/p their/rr 
quest/n for/p more/cc left/vd -/wp handed/v pitching/n ./wj So/cc far/d ,/wd no/rzt takers/n ./wj 
Personally/d ,/wd I/rzt think/v Harris/nz is/vshi a/rzv defensive/a liability/n ,/wd and/c he/rzt 
has/vyou also/d led/v the/rzt team/n in/p past/n years/n for/p hitting/vi into/p double/a 
plays/n ,/wd or/c at/p least/rzs been/vshi among/p the/rzt leaders/n ./wj 

Sharperson/n showed/v last/rzs year/n that/c if/c given/vd a/rzv chance/n to/pba play/n 
every/rzv day/n ,/wd he/rzt can/vyou get/v the/rzt job/n done/vd ./wj If/c Sharpy[sharpie]/vi played/v just/d 
one/m base/n every/rzv day/n ,/wd say/v third/m ,/wd he'd/n also/d improve/v defensively[defensive]/a ./wj 

Wallach/n has/vyou helped/v tremendously/d on/p defense/n ,/wd as/p has/vyou Reed/n ./wj 
The/rzt improved/a defense/n is/vshi quite/d noticeable/n and/c is/vshi having/vyou an/rzv 
effect/n on/p the/rzt pitching/n staff/n ./wj Both/ry Astacio/n AND/c Martinez/nz 
were/vshi bailed[bail]/n out/pbei in/p recent/a starts/v by/p great/a defensive/a plays/n ./wj 
Martinez/nz pitched/v into/p the/rzt ninth/m in/p a/rzv game/n that/c might/vyou 
have/vyou seen/vd him/rzt lifted/v in/p the/rzt third/m in/p past/n years/n ./wj 

Astacio/n lasted/v 7/m innings[inning]/n the/rzt other/rzs day/n under/p similar/a circumstances/n ./wj 
The/rzt Dodgers/n are/vshi turning/vi double/a plays/n ,/wd and/c keeping/vi more/cc balls/n 
in/p the/rzt infield/n than/p last/rzs year./n And/c Piazza/n has/vyou also/d been/vshi great/a 
on/p defense/n ./wj He/rzt has/vyou thrown/vd out/pbei 10/m of/p 14/m batters[batter]/n trying/vi to/pba 
steal/v and/c has/vyou at/p least/rzs one/m pick/v off/p at/p first/m ./wj 

Wallach/n ,/wd clearly/d ,/wd has/vyou contributed/v to/pba the/rzt over/p all/a improvement/n on/p 
defense/n ./wj But/c his/rr offense/n is/vshi awful/a and/c he/rzt has/vyou cost/n the/rzt Dodgers/n 
some/rzv runs/n ./wj But/c I/rzt don't/v think/v he/rzt is/vshi as/p bad/a as/p his/rr current/a average/a ./wj 
I/rzt suspect/v he/rzt will/vyou come/v out/pbei of/p this/r slump/n much/d as/p Davis/nz and/c Straw/n 
seem/v to/pba have/vyou come/v out/pbei of/p theirs/rr ./wj
