I/rzt can/vyou understand/v your/rr anger/n about/p the/rzt German/an audience/n ./wj I/rzt mean/v ,/wd it/rzt was/vshi the/rzt 
Finnish/a team/n they/rzt played/v and/c they/rzt were/vshi taking/vi advantage/n of/p the/rzt ridiculous/a 
penalties/n the/rzt Canadien/n ref/v called/vd in/p the/rzt last/rzs period/n ./wj The/rzt Germans/nl got/v a/rzv 
match/n penalty/n and/c a/rzv 10/m minutes/n misconduct/n for/p practically/d nothing/r and/c 
seconds/n after/p that/c the/rzt German/an goalie/n got/v two/m minutes/n for/p "/w delay/n of/p game/n "/w 
for/p a/rzv shot/n that/c was/vshi deflected/n and/c went/v into/p the/rzt crowd/n ./wj The/rzt resulting/vi 5/m :/wm 3/m

were/vshi starting/v to/pba come/v up/pbei strong/a ./wj 
I/rzt am/vshi also/d sick/a of/p the/rzt nationalism/n that/c is/vshi going/vi on/p in/p German/an sports/n events/n ./wj 
If/c you/rzt watch/v for/p example/n a/rzv tennis/n Davis_Cup/nr match/n the/rzt players/n are/vshi often/d not/d

team/n //wp player/nr1 win/v and/c get/v cheared/n at/p ./wj I/rzt do/vyou not/d mind/n if/c my/rr favorite/a team/n 
looses[loose]/a to/pba somebody/r that/c is/vshi better/a or/c plays/n more/cc attractive/a and/c I/rzt have/vyou to/pba 
admit/v that/c in/p most/cc sports/n the/rzt German/an national/a site/n is/vshi not/d my/rr favorite/a team/n 
to/pba watch/v (/wkz the/rzt German/an soccer/nz team/n is/vshi boring/a to/pba watch/v ,/wd for/p example/n )/wky ./wj 
But/c ,/wd reading/n the/rzt above/p posting[post]/n ,/wd I/rzt think/v that/c you/rzt are/vshi on/p the/rzt same/rzs level/n as/p 
these/r crowds/a you/rzt are/vshi criticizing[criticize]/n ./wj It/rzt is/vshi easy/a to/pba talk/v of/p (/wkz nearly/d all/a )/wky 
Germans_as_Nazis/nt and/c nationalist[nationalist]/nz ;/n thats/n the/rzt kind/n of/p propaganda/n that/c all/a 
ultraconservative/n people/n use/n against/p Germany/nz ./wj It/rzt is/vshi true/a that/c there/rzs is/vshi a/rzv 
great/a danger/n of/p re/p -/wp arising/vi nationalism/n in/p Germany/nz but/c from/p my/rr experience/n 
most/cc of/p the/rzt people/n (/wkz at/p least/rzs of/p the/rzt people/n that/c i/rzt know/v )/wky also/d regard/n this/r as/p 
a/rzv big/a threat/n and/c are/vshi trying/vi to/pba demonstrate/v this/r attitude/n now/d ./wj Why/ry can't/v we/rzt 
just/d look/v at/p people/n as/p human/a beeings/n and/c not/d try/v to/pba put/v them/rzt into/p drawers/n

In/p my/rr opinion/n ,/wd your/rr comment/n shows/v the/rzt narrowness/vi of/p your/rr mind/n and/c that/c you/rzt
