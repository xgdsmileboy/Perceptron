From/p this/r account/n ,/wd it/rzt doesn't/n sound/n like/p you/rzt even/d saw/v the/rzt goal/n ,/wd Mike/nz ./wj Smith/nz 
came/v out/pbei from/p behind/p his/rr own/rzs net/n and/c fired/vd a/rzv breakout/n pass/v that/c hit/v Fuhr/n in/p the/rzt 
back/pbei of/p the/rzt leg/n ./wj Fuhr/n was/vshi backing/n up/pbei at/p the/rzt time/n and/c never/d saw/v what/rzs 
happened/v ./wj The/rzt puck/n went/v straight/d off/p Fuhr/n 's/c leg/n and/c into/p the/rzt net/n ./wj Fuhr/n never/d 
had/vyou a/rzv chance/n ./wj There/rzs was/vshi no/rzt play/n back/pbei to/pba the/rzt goaltender/n ,/wd in/p fact/n Perry_Berezan/nr 
of/p Calgary/n had/vyou just/d dumped/vd it/rzt in/p and/c Smith/nz was/vshi retrieving/n it./rzt 


It/rzt was/vshi unfortunate/a that/c it/rzt happened/v ;/n Smith/nz is/vshi a/rzv nice/a guy/n and/c was/vshi only/d a/rzv rookie/n 
at/p the/rzt time/n ,/wd and/c on/p his/rr birthday/n too/cc ./wj But/c all/a the/rzt blame/v lies/v with/p him/rzt ./wj Starting/v 
in/p pee/nz -/wp wee/a coaches/n tell/v players/n never/d to/pba make/v a/rzv cross/n -/wp ice/n pass/v in/p front/n of/p 
their/rr own/rzs net/n ./wj Too/cc much/d chance/n of/p having/vyou it/rzt intercepted[intercept]/v ,/wd or/c hitting/vi the/rzt 
goaltender/n ,/wd or/c whatever/rzs ./wj 


And/c to/pba the/rzt people/n who/ry say/v that/c Smith/nz cost/n the/rzt Oilers/n the/rzt series/n ,/wd I/rzt can/vyou only/d 
say/v that/c he/rzt certainly/d didn't/v cause/n the/rzt team/n to/pba lose/v the/rzt other/rzs three/m games/n ./wj 
There/rzs was/vshi no/rzt reason/n for/p a/rzv powerhouse/a team/n like/p Edmonton/n to/pba be/vshi tied/vd late/a 
in/p the/rzt third/m period/n of/p the/rzt 7th/ns game/n of/p the/rzt second/m round/n ./wj Everybody/rzv on/p the/rzt team/n 
has/vyou to/pba take/v responsibility/n for/p them/rzt even/d being/vshi in/p that/c situation/n ./wj
