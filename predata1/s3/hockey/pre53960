Let's/v start/n over/p ./wj I'm/n not/d arguing/v about/p who/ry is/vshi the/rzt better/a goaltender/n ./wj I'd/n 
take/v Soderstrom/n right/a now/d ./wj What/rzs I/rzt am/vshi saying/vi is/vshi that/c Roussel/nr can/vyou be/vshi a/rzv #/n 1/m 
netminder/n ./wj The/rzt GAA/nt difference/n is/vshi less/rzs than/p half/n a/rzv goal/n per/p game/n (/wkz less/rzs than/p 
that/c after/p last/rzs night/n )/wky ,/wd their/rr save/v percentages/nz are/vshi close/d ,/wd and/c their/rr records/n 
are/vshi similar/a ./wj And/c with/p that/c ,/wd I/rzt just/d don't/v see/v how/ry you/rzt can/vyou label/n Roussel/nr as/p 
the/rzt most/cc disappointing/a player/nr1 on/p the/rzt Flyers[flier]/nz this/r season/n ./wj 


You/rzt say/v Soderstrom/n played/v against/p better/a competition/n ./wj That/c may/vyou very/cc well/d 
be/vshi ,/wd but/c there/rzs is/vshi no/rzt way/n of/p knowing/vi how/ry Roussel/nr would/vyou have/vyou performed/n in/p 
those/r games/n ./wj Besides/p ,/wd against/p the/rzt better/a scoring/n teams/n like/p Pittsburgh/n ,/wd 
the/rzt defense/n is/vshi more/cc keyed/n up/pbei than/p they/rzt are/vshi against/p San_Jose/nr ./wj 


>/wm The/rzt same/rzs 
>/wm for/p Roussel/nr in/p the/rzt Ranger/nz game/n ./wj Two/m real/a scoring/n chances/n ,/wd one/m he/rzt made/vd a/rzv 
>/wm great/a play/n ,/wd the/rzt other/rzs he/rzt was/vshi saved/vd by/p a/rzv mistake/n from/p the/rzt other/rzs player/nr1 ./wj If/c 
>/wm you/rzt were/vshi judging/n Roussel/nr on/p that/c game/n alone/d ,/wd you/rzt have/vyou very/cc little/a to/pba go/v by/p ./wj 


But/c I'm/n not/d just/d judging/n Roussel/nr on/p that/c game/n alone/d ./wj I've/n seen/vd him/rzt play/n 
for/p the/rzt past/n two/m seasons/n in/p Philly/n and/c before/p that/c in/p Hershey/n ./wj It's/v just/d 
my/rr opinion/n ,/wd but/c I/rzt think/v he/rzt 's/c got/v what/rzs it/rzt takes/v ./wj Of/p course/n ,/wd I/rzt thought/v that/c 
about/p Mark_LaForest/nr ,/wd too/cc ./wj But/c I/rzt never/d did/vyou about/p Wendell_Young/nr ./wj So/cc I'm/n 
batting/n .500/m in/p judging/n Hershey/n talent/n since/p the/rzt Hextall/n -/wp era/n ./wj 


As/p for/p the/rzt Rangers[ranger]/nz game/n ,/wd you/rzt can/vyou say/v he/rzt was/vshi saved/vd by/p a/rzv mistake/n by/p the/rzt 
offensive/a player/nr1 if/c you/rzt like/p ./wj But/c Rou/n had/vyou his/rr leg/n in/p position/n to/pba make/v the/rzt

get/v the/rzt puck/n up/pbei or/c not/d ./wj It/rzt would/vyou have/vyou been/vshi a/rzv goal/n ./wj On/p a/rzv breakaway/a that's/v 
what/rzs the/rzt goalie/n wants/v to/pba do/vyou ,/wd take/v away/pbei as/p much/d as/p possible/a and/c force/n the/rzt 
shooter/n to/pba beat/n him/rzt ./wj 


>/wm But/c if/c you/rzt were/vshi to/pba look/v at/p the/rzt 0/m -/wp 0/m tie/n against/p the/rzt Habs/n ,/wd you/rzt saw/v a/rzv goalie/n 
>/wm stand/v on/p his/rr head/n to/pba get/v that/c shutout/n ./wj THAT/c was/vshi a/rzv #/n 1/m goalie/n in/p action/n ./wj Roussel/nr 
>/wm doesn't/n have/vyou a/rzv game/n like/p that/c in/p him/rzt ./wj 


I/rzt seem/v to/pba remember/v Roussel/nr doing/vi an/rzv excellent/a job/n against/p Pittsurgh/n on/p 
opening/n night/n to/pba give/v the/rzt Flyers[flier]/nz a/rzv tie/n against/p the/rzt two/m -/wp time/n defending/vi 
champs/n ./wj And/c not/d to/pba take/v anything/r away/pbei from/p Soderstrom/n because/c he/rzt was/vshi 
senational/n in/p that/c game/n agains/n the/rzt Habs/n ./wj But/c you/rzt can't/v tell/v me/rzv that/c a/rzv 
Montreal/n player/nr1 had/vyou an/rzv open/a net/n to/pba shoot/v at/p some/rzv point/n during/p that/c game/n 
and/c just/d flat/n out/pbei missed/v it./rzt Mistakes/n ,/wd both/ry on/p offense/n and/c defense/n are/vshi 
part/n of/p the/rzt game/n ./wj Or/c there'd/nz never/d be/vshi shutouts/n ./wj 


Anyway/d ,/wd I'm/n happy/a the/rzt Flyers[flier]/nz have/vyou both/ry Soderstrom/n and/c Roussel/nr and/c
