Gant/nr went/v ./wj Then/d he/rzt casually/d leaned/v against/p his/rr bat/n ./wj I/rzt don't/v blame/v the/rzt 
umpire/n at/p all/a for/p telling/vi the/rzt pitcher/n to/pba pitch/n ./wj 


The/rzt worst/a part/n of/p the/rzt whole/a incident/n was/vshi the/rzt Braves/nz coming/vi out/pbei onto/p the/rzt 
field/n ./wj What/rzs were/vshi they/rzt going/vi to/pba do/vyou ,/wd attack/n the/rzt umpire/n ?/ww The/rzt only/d people/n 
who/ry should've/n been/vshi out/pbei there/rzs were/vshi Cox/nz and/c maybe/d the/rzt coaches/n ,/wd but/c NO/rzt players/n ./wj 
I/rzt agree/v with/p the/rzt person/n who/ry posted/vd before/p that/c Cox/nz should/vyou be/vshi suspended/vd for/p 
having/vyou no/rzt control/n over/p his/rr team/n ./wj
