Subject/n :/wm proposed/n catcher/n re/p -/wp sub/n rule/n 


A/rzv lot/n of/p teams/n carry/v 3/m catchers[catcher]/n on/p their/rr 25/m man/n roster/n ,/wd 
but/c the/rzt 3rd/ns catcher/n is/vshi seldom/d ever/d used/vd ./wj He/rzt is/vshi only/d 
insurance/n in/p case/n of/p extra/a innings[inning]/n or/c the/rzt 2nd/ns catcher/n 
is/vshi injured/a during/p a/rzv game/n ./wj So/cc to/pba free/a up/pbei this/r roster/n 
spot/n for/p an/rzv extra/a pinch/n hitter/n or/c reliever/n ,/wd why/ry not/d 
invoke/v a/rzv catcher/n re/p -/wp substitution/n rule/n :/wm 


If/c the/rzt last/rzs roster/n catcher/n on/p a/rzv team/n is/vshi 
injured/a during/p a/rzv game/n ,/wd the/rzt team/n is/vshi permitted/v 
to/pba substitute/n in/p his/rr place/v for/p defensive/a purposes/n 
a/rzv catcher/n who/ry has/vyou previously/a been/vshi yanked/vd from/p 
the/rzt game/n ./wj 


Given/vd this/r rule/n ,/wd a/rzv team/n wouldn't/v need/n 3/m roster/n 
catchers[catcher]/n ./wj The/rzt 3rd/ns catcher/n could/vyou be/vshi playing/vi 
in/p AAA/nt or/c be/vshi a/rzv non/u -/wp roster/n bullpen/n catcher/n ./wj
