For/p anyone/r else/d following/a along/p ,/wd it/rzt is/vshi a/rzv well/d -/wp known/vd and/c demonstrable/n fact/n 
that/c a/rzv team/n 's/c win/v -/wp loss/n record/n is/vshi closely/d related/vd to/pba the/rzt number/n of/p runs/n the/rzt 
team/n scores/n and/c the/rzt number/n the/rzt team/n allows/v ./wj It's/v not/d a/rzv definite/a ,/wd 
hard/a -/wp and/c -/wp fast/d function/n ,/wd but/c there/rzs is/vshi definitely/d a/rzv correlation/n ./wj In/p fact/n ,/wd as/p a/rzv 
rule/n of/p thumb/n ,/wd if/c teams/n A/rzv and/c B/o both/ry score/n X/n runs/n and/c team/n A/rzv allows/v Y/o runs/n ,/wd 
for/p every/rzv 10/m runs/n fewer/rzs than/p Y/o that/c team/n B/o allows/v ,/wd it/rzt will/vyou win/v another/r game/n ./wj 
So/cc ,/wd for/p instance/n ,/wd if/c we/rzt look/v at/p the/rzt 1991/m Toronto_Blue_jay/nr ,/wd we/rzt find/v that/c 
they/rzt scored/v 780/m runs/n and/c allowed/vd 682/m ,/wd of/p which/rzs Morris/nz allowed/vd 114/m ./wj All/a other/rzs

enough/a for/p 1/m -/wp 2/m more/cc wins/v ./wj Now/d ,/wd that/c doesn't/n take/v into/p account/n that/c Viola/n
