Yes/o -/wp Everyone/r seems/v to/pba be/vshi in/p agreement/n that/c the/rzt Yankees/nl are/vshi 
finally/d moving/vi in/p the/rzt right/a direction/n ./wj They/rzt should/vyou finish/n 
over/p .500/m this/r year/n and/c maybe/d even/d be/vshi in/p the/rzt pennent/n race/n 
in/p August/t ./wj However/d ,/wd I/rzt would/vyou take/v back/pbei a/rzv few/rzs moves/v :/wm 


1/m ./wj The/rzt Jim_Abbott_Trade/nr ./wj 
I/rzt think/v Abbott/n is/vshi not/d only/d an/rzv inspirational/a person/n ,/wd but/c a/rzv 
great/a pitcher/n also/d ./wj He/rzt could/vyou win/v the/rzt Cy_Young/nr this/r year/n ,/wd 
but/c he/rzt won't/v because/c the/rzt right/a side/n of/p the/rzt Yanks/nl infield/n 
isn't/n good/a enough/a ./wj So/cc why/ry was/vshi this/r not/d a/rzv good/a trade/n ?/ww 
JT_Snow/nr ./wj How/ry many/rzs rookies/n have/vyou been/vshi able/a to/pba step/n in/p and/c 
immediately/d have/vyou the/rzt impact/n that/c he/rzt has/vyou had/vyou so/cc far/d on/p 
the/rzt Angels/n ?/ww I/rzt know/v it's/v early/a ,/wd but/c if/c you've/n seen/vd this/r kid/n 
hit/v ,/wd field/n or/c talk/v you/rzt can/vyou just/d tell/v that/c he/rzt is/vshi going/vi to/pba be/vshi 
a/rzv tremendous/a player/nr1 ./wj The/rzt Yanks/nl should/vyou have/vyou kept/v him/rzt ./wj What/rzs 
about/p Mattingly/nr ,/wd you/rzt ask/v ?/ww Well/d -/wp it's/v great/a that/c the/rzt Yanks/nl 
have/vyou taken/vd care/n of/p him/rzt and/c remained/v loyal/a ,/wd but/c he/rzt 's/c 10/m years/n 
older/a than/p Snow/n and/c just/d doesn't/n have/vyou the/rzt same/rzs bat/n speed/n as/p 
before/p his/rr back/pbei injury/n ./wj It's/v a/rzv shame/n ,/wd but/c as/p a/rzv Yankee/an fan/n 
who/ry wants/v to/pba see/v the/rzt */n best/a */n Yankee/an team/n ,/wd I'd/n take/v 
Snow_over_Mattingly/nt at/p first/m ./wj The/rzt Yanks/nl also/d gave/v up/pbei two/m 
promising/a propects/n with/p Snow_for_Abbott/nt ./wj Besides/p ,/wd with/p 
Domingo_Jean/nr ,/wd Brien/nr taylor/nz ,/wd Wickman/n ,/wd Militello/n ,/wd and/c Sterling/n 
Hitchcock/nz ,/wd they/rzt are/vshi just/d loaded/vd with/p propects/n ./wj I/rzt know/v Abbotts/n 
only/d 26/m ,/wd but/c this/r was/vshi too/cc much/d to/pba give/v up/pbei ./wj I/rzt believe/v George/nz 
forced/vd this/r trade/n because/c he/rzt believes/v (/wkz and/c he/rzt 's/c right/a )/wky that/c 
Abbott/n will/vyou be/vshi a/rzv big/a hit/v in/p NY/u ./wj However/d ,/wd I'd/n like/p to/pba see/v the/rzt 
Yankees/nl build/v a/rzv baseball/n team/n ,/wd not/d an/rzv amusement/n show/v ./wj 


2/m ./wj Wade_Boggs/nr ./wj 
I/rzt live/v in/p Boston/ns and/c like/p Wade/v a/rzv lot/n ./wj But/c ,/wd his/rr career/n is/vshi 
winding/a down/pbei and/c I/rzt would/vyou rather/d see/v the/rzt Yanks/nl start/n to/pba develop/v 
a/rzv long/a term/n solution/n (/wkz i.e./n Hensley_Muelins/nr ,/wd Russ_Davis/nr ,/wd Velarde/nr ?/ww )/wky ./wj 
Besides/p ,/wd Wade/v just/d doesn't/n have/vyou any/rzv range/n ./wj What/rzs a/rzv shame/n about/p 
Charlie_Hayes/nr ,/wd huh/vi ?/ww 


3/m ./wj Spike_Owen/nr ./wj 
See_Wade_Boggs/nr ./wj I'd/n much/d rather/d see/v them/rzt develop/v Dave_Silvestri/nr 
or/c whoever/ry ./wj Wade/v and/c Spike/a next/rzs to/pba each/r other/rzs in/p the/rzt infield/n is/vshi 
going/vi to/pba raise/v the/rzt Yankee/an staff/n ERA/n 1/m //wp 2/m point/n ./wj And/c these/r guys/n 
are/vshi on/p the/rzt down/pbei sides/n of/p their/rr careers/n ./wj 


4/m ./wj Danny_Tartabull/nr ./wj 
Yes/o -/wp he/rzt 's/c put/v up/pbei some/rzv tremendous/a numbers/n and/c it's/v nice/a to/pba think/v 
about/p what/rzs he/rzt could/vyou do/vyou if/c he/rzt were/vshi ever/d healthy/a all/a year./n But/c he/rzt 
never/d is/vshi ./wj We/rzt should/vyou expect/v 120/m games/n max/nz out/pbei of/p him/rzt ./wj Meanwhile/d ,/wd 
Gerald_Williams/nr is/vshi playing/vi at/p Columbus/nz and/c Paul_O'Neil/nr is/vshi playing/vi 
left/vd field/n !/wt I/rzt believe/v O'Neil/n led/v NL/nt outfielders[outfielder]/n in/p assists[assist]/v 
last/rzs year/n -/wp and/c Tartabull/n is/vshi a/rzv poor/a defensive/a outfielder/n ./wj 


What/rzs I'm/n basically/d getting/vi at/p is/vshi the/rzt Yanks/nl are/vshi moving/vi in/p the/rzt right/a 
direction/n but/c are/vshi NOT/d ready/a to/pba win/v a/rzv pennent/n this/r year./n They/rzt should/vyou 
(/wkz at/p the/rzt GM/nt level/n )/wky be/vshi planning/n for/p a/rzv 1994/m or/c 1995/m world/n series/n ./wj This/r 
means/n getting/vi the/rzt younger/a players/n experience/n in/p the/rzt majors/n NOW/d so/cc they/rzt 
will/vyou be/vshi ready/a in/p a/rzv year/n or/c two/m ./wj 


I'm/n afraid/a that/c all/a this/r stuff/n wreaks/n of/p George_Steinbrenner/nr ./wj 
Certainly/d ,/wd the/rzt Boggs/nr deal/n was/vshi all/a George/nz ./wj It/rzt looks/v like/p George/nz is/vshi 
planning/n the/rzt right/a mix/v of/p veterans/n and/c young/a players/n to/pba win/v a/rzv world/n 
series/n now/d ./wj The/rzt veterans/n are/vshi always/d available/a and/c can/vyou be/vshi added/v at/p any/rzv 
time/n (/wkz like/p Boston/ns did/vyou this/r year/n )/wky ./wj Develop/v the/rzt young/a players/n first/m ,/wd 
then/d add/v the/rzt one/m or/c two/m veterans/n (/wkz or/c in/p the/rzt Yankees/nl case/n ,/wd just/d keep/v 
them/rzt )/wky ./wj Let's/v all/a us/rzv Yankee/an fans/n hope/n that/c George/nz doesn't/n dismantle/a 
the/rzt terrific/d job/n Stick/n and/c company/n have/vyou done/vd building/n the/rzt Yankee/an 
organization/n back/pbei into/p one/m of/p respect/n ./wj I'm/n really/d afraid/a that/c he/rzt will/vyou 
trade/n whoever/ry it/rzt takes/v to/pba patch/n holes/n today/t (/wkz relief/n pitching/n for/p
