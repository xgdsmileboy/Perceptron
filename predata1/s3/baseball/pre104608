The/rzt media/n is/vshi beating/n the/rzt incident/n at/p Dodger_Stadium_on_Wednesday/nt to/pba 
death/n ,/wd but/c I/rzt haven't/v seen/vd anything/r in/p rsb/n yet/d ./wj 


Gerald_Perry/nr of/p the/rzt Cardinals/n pinch/n hit/v in/p the/rzt eighth/m inning/n with/p two/m 
on/p and/c his/rr club/n down/pbei by/p a/rzv run/v ./wj He/rzt stroked/v a/rzv line/n drive/n into/p the/rzt 
right/a field/n corner/n ./wj The/rzt ball/n cleared/vd the/rzt three/m -/wp foot/n high/a fence/n and/c 
went/v into/p the/rzt crowd/n ./wj Darryl/nr ,/wd racing/n over/p from/p right/a center/n ,/wd got/v to/pba 
the/rzt spot/n in/p time/n to/pba reach/v his/rr glove/n up/pbei over/p the/rzt short/a fence/n ,/wd but/c he/rzt 
missed/v the/rzt ball/n ./wj A/rzv fan/n sitting/vi in/p the/rzt front/n row/n ,/wd wearing/vi a/rzv mitt/n ,/wd 
reached/v up/pbei and/c caught/v the/rzt ball/n ./wj Home/n run/v ./wj 


Now/d I've/n seen/vd the/rzt replay/v several/rzs times/n and/c I/rzt have/vyou concluded/v that/c 
Darryl/nr missed/v the/rzt ball/n ,/wd and/c that/c the/rzt fan/n 's/c glove/n was/vshi essentially/d 
behind/p Darryl's/n ./wj Several/rzs Dodger/n fans/n with/p seats/n in/p the/rzt immediate/a 
vicinity/n have/vyou claimed/v that/c the/rzt fan/n unquestionably/d interfered/v with/p 
Strawberry/n ./wj What/rzs cannot/n be/vshi disputed[dispute]/n ,/wd however/d ,/wd is/vshi that/c the/rzt fan/n 
who/ry caught/v the/rzt ball/n never/d took/v his/rr eye/n off/p it/rzt ;/n he/rzt was/vshi oblivious/a 
to/pba where/ry the/rzt fielder/n was/vshi playing/vi ./wj He/rzt was/vshi also/d quite/d exuberant/a as/p 
soon/d as/p he/rzt realized/v he/rzt had/vyou made/vd the/rzt catch/v ./wj 


That/c exuberance/n disappeared/vd immediately/d ,/wd however/d ,/wd when/ry Strawberry/n 
went/v into/p a/rzv tirade/a at/p the/rzt man/n ./wj All/a reports/n indicate/v he/rzt used/vd a/rzv lot/n 
of/p profanity/n and/c accused/vd the/rzt man/n of/p interference/n ,/wd and/c therefore/d of/p 
costing/vi the/rzt Dodgers/n a/rzv game/n ./wj Shortly/d afterwards/d other/rzs fans/n hurled/v 
food/n and/c beverages/n toward/p the/rzt man/n who/ry made/vd the/rzt catch/v ./wj Dodger_Stadium/ns 
officials/n started/v to/pba remove/v him/rzt from/p the/rzt park/n ,/wd but/c then/d relented/n and/c 
just/d relocated/n him/rzt to/pba another/r area/n ./wj In/p an/rzv interview/n after/p the/rzt game/n ,/wd 
Lasorda/n blamed/vd the/rzt fan/n for/p the/rzt loss/n ./wj Strawberry/n also/d went/v into/p a/rzv 
tirade/a about/p how/ry the/rzt fans/n are/vshi stupid/a and/c they/rzt don't/v care/n about/p 
winning/a ./wj L.A/nt ./wj Times/n columnists[columnist]/n similarly/d blast[blast]/n the/rzt man/n who/ry made/vd 
the/rzt catch/v ./wj 


Before/p each/r Dodger/n game/n the/rzt public/a address/n announcer/nr1 makes/v a/rzv speech/n 
wherein/ry he/rzt says/v that/c fans/n are/vshi welcome/a to/pba the/rzt souvenirs/n of/p balls/n that/c 
are/vshi hit/v into/p the/rzt stands/v as/p long/a as/p they/rzt do/vyou not/d interfere/v with/p any/rzv 
that/c are/vshi in/p the/rzt field/n of/p play/n ./wj Was/vshi the/rzt fan/n wrong/a ?/ww Should/vyou he/rzt have/vyou 
been/vshi more/cc aware/a of/p the/rzt situation/n and/c acted/v to/pba avoid/v any/rzv possibility/n 
of/p interference/n ?/ww Or/c was/vshi he/rzt human/a and/c just/d reacting/vi ?/ww By/p the/rzt way/n ,/wd he/rzt 
is/vshi a/rzv season/n ticket/n holder/n and/c on/p his/rr request/n the/rzt Dodgers/n have/vyou relocated/n 
his/rr seats/n to/pba another/r area/n of/p the/rzt Stadium/n where/ry future/n interference/n is/vshi 
impossible/a ./wj 


Others/ry have/vyou questioned/vd why/ry Darryl/nr should/vyou be/vshi so/cc concerned/vd with/p what/rzs 
the/rzt fan/n did/vyou when/ry he/rzt has/vyou a/rzv grand/a total/a of/p 1/m rbi/n through/p the/rzt first/m 
nine/m games/n ./wj 


I/rzt question/n what/rzs he/rzt was/vshi doing/vi in/p right/a center/n with/p a/rzv left/vd -/wp handed/v pull/v 
hitter/n up/pbei and/c the/rzt game/n on/p the/rzt line/n ./wj Had/vyou he/rzt been/vshi closer/a to/pba the/rzt play/n ,/wd 
he/rzt certainly/d would/vyou have/vyou had/vyou a/rzv much/d better/a chance/n of/p catching/vi the/rzt ball/n ./wj 


But/c I/rzt guess/v the/rzt big/a debate/n continues/v as/p to/pba what/rzs are/vshi the/rzt responsibilities/n 
of/p the/rzt fan/n ./wj
