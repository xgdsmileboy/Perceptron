It/rzt is/vshi doubtful/n that/c the/rzt blue/a jay[jay]/nz would/vyou have/vyou won/v the/rzt AL/nz east/nz without/p Morris/nz ./wj

Morris/nz went/v 5/m -/wp 1/m with/p a/rzv pretty/d good/a era/n (/wkz I/rzt can't/v remember/v exactly/d )/wky ./wj 
Also/d ,/wd let's/v not/d underestimate/v the/rzt importance/n his/rr 240/m +/wp innings[inning]/n to/pba save/v

His/rr run/v support/n was/vshi high/a (/wkz 5.98/m runs/n )/wky but/c so/cc was/vshi Stottlemyer/n 's/c (/wkz 5.90/m runs/n )/wky
