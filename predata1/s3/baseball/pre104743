So/cc what/rzs is/vshi your/rr definition/n of/p "/w interfering/vi with/p the/rzt fielder/n taking/vi the/rzt throw/v "/w ?/ww 


The/rzt rule/n book/n certainly/d doesn't/n have/vyou a/rzv definiton/n or/c clarification/n ,/wd so/cc it's/v 
possible/a to/pba interpret/v the/rzt rule/n as/p saying/vi that/c if/c the/rzt catcher/n has/vyou to/pba alter/v 
his/rr throw/v to/pba avoid/v hitting/vi the/rzt batter/n -/wp runner/a ,/wd then/d again/d we/rzt have/vyou interference/n ./wj 
You/rzt know/v ,/wd it/rzt seems/v that/c there/rzs is/vshi no/rzt way/n to/pba apply/v this/r rule/n justly/d -/wp -/wp if/c the/rzt 
catcher/n (/wkz or/c the/rzt pitcher/n ,/wd say/v Rob_Dibble/nr ,/wd for/p example/n )/wky throws/rzs toward/p first/m 
and/c hits/a the/rzt runner/a running/vi inside/p the/rzt baseline/a ,/wd the/rzt fielder/n takes/v the/rzt chance/n 
of/p being/vshi ejected/vd ./wj Therefore/d he/rzt probably/d would/vyou throw/v around/p the/rzt runner/a or/c 
(/wkz your/rr scenario/n )/wky above/p him/rzt ./wj 


You/rzt should/vyou note/n that/c in/p our/rr American_Legion_League/nt ,/wd (/wkz which/rzs uses/v MLB/nt rules/n )/wky we/rzt 
interpret/v the/rzt rule/n to/pba say/v in/p this/r very/cc circumstance/n there/rzs IS/vshi interference/n 
per/p rule/n 7.09/m ./wj
