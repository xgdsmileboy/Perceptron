The/rzt problem/n with/p your/rr nihilistic/n approach/n ,/wd Roger/nz ,/wd is/vshi that/c it/rzt takes/v all/a the/rzt

on/p what/rzs might/vyou have/vyou happened/v if/c things/n had/vyou gone/vd otherwise/d ,/wd so/cc the/rzt double/a 
play/n is/vshi merely/d an/rzv event/n that/c happened/v in/p the/rzt course/n of/p a/rzv game/n that/c was/vshi 
eventually/d won/v or/c lost/vd for/p unknown/a reasons/n ./wj After/p all/a ,/wd any/rzv speculation/n 
involves/vd constructing/vi a/rzv fantasy/n about/p what/rzs would/vyou have/vyou happened/v but/c didn't/v ./wj 


Roger/nz ,/wd do/vyou you/rzt ever/d worry/n that/c the/rzt next/rzs pencil/n you/rzt drop/n will/vyou fall/n to/pba the/rzt
