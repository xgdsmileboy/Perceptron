an/rzv issue/n because/c they/rzt like/p shorter/a games/n -/wp they/rzt get/v to/pba head/n back/pbei to/pba hotel/n

they/rzt have/vyou deadlines[deadline]/n ./wj The/rzt ESPN/nt guys/n on/p baseball/n tonight/t drive/n me/rzv crazy/a -/wp they/rzt

when/ry the/rzt game/n goes/v longer/a than/p 2/m :/wm 30/m ./wj 


Maybe/d I/rzt am/vshi just/d a/rzv ne'er/n -/wp do/vyou -/wp well/d with/p nothing/r better/a to/pba do/vyou ,/wd but/c I/rzt
